\chapter{Introduction}
This technical note is aimed to document the design of ideal cross domain bulk
transfer mechanism that we wish to have in Barrelfish.


\section{Existing implementation in Barrelfish}
There are two bulk transfer mechanisms that exist in the current(as of August
2011) implementation of Barrelfish.
\texttt{$lib/barrelfish/bulk\_transfer.c$}
and \textit{pbufs} used in the network stack.  We will discuss them briefly in
following two sub-sections.

\subsection{$bulk\_transfer.c/h$}
